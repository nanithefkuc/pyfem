This is my poor attempt at a FEA solver. Below is a list of what is and isn't supported

### Supported:
* 3 shape types: rectangle, circle, semicircle
* CVT-optimised mesh

### Not supported:
* Rotation of any shapes
* Further mesh optimisation
* The actual FEA part of this whole thing (lol)

I don't know what I am doing.
